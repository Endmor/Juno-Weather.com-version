# todo 
add more of the weather icons becase it is currently missing winter based ones

update the settings skin to work with the changes

# usage

go to weather.com and copy the location code from the url into @Settings/Variables.inc under location=

example weatherCode=UKXX0085:1:UK



# known bugs

it currently only displays the hi point for the day becouse adding <tmp> in RegExp to display the current temperature breaks the icons and conditions from displaying anything
