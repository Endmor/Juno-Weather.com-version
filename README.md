# todo 
icons may need to be renamed to work properly with the weather.com api

update the settings skin to work with the changes

# usage

go to weather.com and copy the location code from the url into @Settings/Variables.inc



# known bugs

it currently only displays the hi point for the day becouse adding <tmp> in RegExp to display the current temperature breaks the icons and conditions from displaying anything
